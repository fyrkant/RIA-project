**This is the project-repository for the course RIA-development with Javascript.**

Project description
This spring I started working with an advertising page for freecycling, i.e adverts with things that people
 who wants to give away to someone else instead of throwing them away. I finished most of it but I had one thing remaining,
 the login functions. As that is something very crucial to a site like that I want to explore the world of login
 during this project.


I will work with a simple form for creating adverts, a loginsystem that connects the users to only their adverts with
the possibility to remove or change an advert.

I will work in JavaScript, using ReactJS for the front-end and Firebase for the advert/user-database. The project will be published
with Github Pages.
